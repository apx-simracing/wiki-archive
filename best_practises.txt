====== Best practises ======

  - Use a strong secret and and not the standard port on the reciever
  - Prefix your mod pack with something, people can then just delete everything with *yourprefix* in case of issues
  - Control your [[event configuration]] before deploying
  - Avoid whitespaces in --args, encapsulate multi-part strings with "", e. g. "Günther Hubspecht" instead of Günther Hubspecht
  - Make your server as closed as possible, in the best case close any port except the rFactor require ports and the reciever port
  - Use SSD's, not HDD servers
  - Use no virtual machines unless you control the hypervisor
  - Disable replays
  - Consider running the reciever with an unprivileged user with minimal permissions


====== Security considerations ====== 

  - You should consider running the reciever using an unprivileged user with suitable directory permissions
  - Keep the reciever as often updated as possible
  - Apply your server udpates frequently.
  - Keep your firewall as closed as possible
