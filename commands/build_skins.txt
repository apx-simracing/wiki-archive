====== build_skins ======

===== Purpose =====

This command builds an intermediate skin pack to be uploaded on the server. The command utilizes the [[:setup|directory structure]] configured in the [[:servers.json]] file.

Following paths must be set in the [[:servers.json]] entry:

  * build_path: This file contains subdirectories named by the vehicle components, e. g. "Corvette_C7R_GTE_2017" or "Oreca_07_LMP2_2017"
  * out_path: temporary files only
  * packs_path: For each component, a *.tar.gz file will be created and uploaded to the target server's build directory.
  * templates_path: The path where the template VEH files are stored

After packaging the *.tar.gz archives, the file will be uploaded to the server and pasted in the build directory.
