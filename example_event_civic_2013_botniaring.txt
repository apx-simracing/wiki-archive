====== Example Event: Honda Civic BTCC 2013 @ Botniaring ======


APX will require the item steam ID's. If you have the item URL, it's the number after "id=" (so e. g. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=**1553094081**&searchtext=botniar)

  * Honda Civic BTCC 2013: 922034382
  * Botniaring: 1553094081

<WRAP center round info 80%>
You have to do this configuration once. If updates are released, just run the last command again.
</WRAP>

===== Identifying content =====


Subscribe these items on your local computer and start up rFactor 2 as we need some informations:

  * Vehicle cars
  * Component versions
  * Component names
  * Layout of the choosed track

==== Getting component names and versions ====

In the launcher package list, identify your content. We will need the name (which is often something like <Name>_<Year>) and a version (or you can just use "latest" as a version). Do this for all the used content:

{{:botniaring.png?1000|}}

and the car:

{{:civic.png?1000|}}

You can find these informations als from the folder structure when looking into ///Installed/Vehicles// and ///Installed/Locations//

==== Getting content infos ====

Next, startup rFactor 2. We will have now to identify the contents of your selected mods.

  - For a track, note the desired layout name, here e. g. "Botniaring Short".
  - For a car: Note down at least one available vehicle, e. g. "Honda Civic NGTC #1" (Remember: non-numeric values in car numbers are not allowed -even although they may be existing)

{{::botniaring_layoutsd.png?400|}}
{{:civic_entries.png?400|}}

===== Creating the event JSON file=====

As we now collected all required informations, we can create the event json file. You can drop this file everywhere on your computer, you just need to remember it's path.

==== Recommendation: ====

  * Make sure you version and name the mod properly. If a mod was updated, but neither version or name changed, it causes an mod install error/ clients are stuck in the loading screen
  * Set the "WebUI port" to an open port **per server**. It will be used for per-user status checking
  * Even for workshop mods, always name vehicle entries (at least one!)
