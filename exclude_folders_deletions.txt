====== Exclude folders from deletions ======


<WRAP center round info 60%>
Take caution when excluding Packages or steamapps from being removed. This basically disables core features of APX.
</WRAP>

On deployment, following folders will be removed

  * Replays
  * Log
  * Packages
  * appcache
  * steamapps
  * player/Settings

To keep one of these folders, place an empty text file named "apx-keep.txt" in the folder.

In the log, you will see following messages then:

<code>
Apr 01 20:23:21 deploy.py:515 INFO [17728]: Ignoring the folder C:\Users\chm\Documents\rfactor-server\server\UserData\Log as it's marked as to be kept.
</code>
