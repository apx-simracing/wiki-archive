===== Footnotes: =====

*1 it's implemented, but relies on pywinauto. It's topic for further changes.

*2 the server endpoint does not expose this (yet).

*3 not //really// targeted for implementation. Will be added if needed for another feature. Would require a client for it, which is not really planned as it would be A LOT of work.

*4 the wizard currently groups the files per component, but not per version

*5 Supported by the reciever, but no control interface, see https://wiki.apx.chmr.eu/doku.php?id=file_based_content
