====== Use of a global steamcmd ======

A global steamcmd is in the wizard context a single steamcmd copy for all managed servers. This reduces the hard drive space needed for the whole setup, but has some disadvantages:

  - If you do parallel installations, this might cause issues as I did not find a documentation on how steamcmd behaves when multiple installations are requested
  - If you have APX-created servers and servers with a manual installation, this will cause issues, so you cannot mix global steamcmd usage and server steamcmd usage
  - The server option //Remove unused workshop items// cannot be used if //USE_GLOBAL_STEAMCMD// is set to //True//
