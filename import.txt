====== Import files into APX ======

Large amounts of files can be imported using the script //import.bat//. The script reads files from an folder //import// in the wizard base directory. It may not exist at start, so you may create it first.

===== Requirements =====

  * Components (either cars or for tracks) must exist inside of APX
  * **For tracks:** The track layout needed for import must be existing inside of APX

===== Import files for entries =====

To import files for entries, follow following steps

  - Can entries be alphanumeric (e. g. '13x')? Y/N: **n**
  - Do you want to set team names Y/N: **n**
  - Is this okay? Y/N: **y**

==== Alphanumeric vs Numeric ====

This question is important toa llow the import to group the files. Alphanumeric beans that the entry number can consist out of any character and numbers while numeric only allows numbers.


==== Set team names ====

If confirmed, you can add the names per car to the entries. The names will be used then. If you don't want to set team names at all, just deny the question or confirm each entry with enter. The default team name is the component.
