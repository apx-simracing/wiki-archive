====== How to install updates ======


===== Files to keep =====

You don't want to overwrite following files (they should not be included in the releases, but just to make sure). Create a backup of these files:

  * db.sqlite3 (if you are using sqlite)
  * uploads/
  * packs/
  * server_children/
  * wizard/settings.py
