====== Limitations ======
  * APX works on top of pywinauto to interact with a running server. This is flaky and an open to-do
  * The build process is large and not verbose enough
  * Not every use case will be covered

===== What actions rely on the GUI? =====

  * Ban/ Kicking of clients
  * Adding bots
  * All votes

===== Mixing of default and own liveries for a component =====

This is currently not supported. If an component requires  liveries, decided if you run default or custom liveries. But no mix-ups.


===== Why do I need several servers instead of profiles =====

APX follows the approach to isolate each deployment/ event from others. This prevents the servers from suffer from broken mods b/c of old artefacts.
