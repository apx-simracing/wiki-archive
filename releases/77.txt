  * Fixed an issue within the demo data to remove the need to save the demo event once before deploying the first time

  * Fixed an issue causing the mas files not to be seen on deployment to inject grip settings

  * Add option to deny calls or votes on a event

  * The grip needle can now also be set to "green" or "natural" to either get a green or naturally progressing starting point to the server

  * Servers installed with APX can now rely on the same items folder. This folder is located in the folder "uploads". This allows all APX-created rFactor 2 servers to rely on the same pool of non-workshop items.

  * Updated https://wiki.apx.chmr.eu/doku.php?id=file_based_content to reflect the new folder structures for managed servers

  * Updated https://wiki.apx.chmr.eu/doku.php?id=track_updates to feature infos about why (external) rfcmp files are not supported

  * Added the McLaren Senna to the common component list https://wiki.apx.chmr.eu/doku.php?id=common_component

  * The plugins field in the event detail is now usable again

  * In the case (for whatever reasons) when the Settings folder does not exist will APX now create the folder on the fly at deployment

  * The layout filter feature does not work at the moment, I extended the troubleshooting article: https://wiki.apx.chmr.eu/doku.php?id=troubleshooting#i_see_all_layouts_within_the_server_but_i_only_need_one

  * Fixed an issue causing the grip files not to be in the order display within the log, causing the grip needle to return wrong or unwanted matches

  * Add field to the event configuration to control AI strength

  * Change the multi select for plugins so it's using checkboxes

  * Fixed an issue with the wrong workshop ID for the Radical_SR3-RSX_2017 on the https://wiki.apx.chmr.eu/doku.php?id=common_components article

  * Add the Radical_SR3-XX_2020 to the common component list

  * Add the option to clean up steamcmd downloads to save storage in the server options

  * Add import script to import large amounts of existing files to entries and track files

  * Add article on the import script https://wiki.apx.chmr.eu/doku.php?id=import

  * Removed the vehicle vs track question at the import as the type of the desired component can be derived from the short name

  * Added comparison between numeric and alphanumeric numbering schemes

  * Removed need to define the separator char

  * The import can rename files according to the APX required naming scheme as long as the number can be clearly identified

  * Added confirmation list

  * Added the livery file purpose to the import confirm list

<code>
Entry x64:
         File aston_x64.dds: (Livery main file)
         File aston_x64_Region.dds: (Livery region)
Entry sample rename#045:
         File foo_045.dds => aston_045.dds: (Livery main file)
         File foo_045_Region.dds => aston_045_Region.dds: (Livery region)
</code>


  * Add option to give entries team names (input is done via stdin)

<code>
Do you want to set team names? Y/N: y
Name of team with car #064 (enter to omit): My team
Name of team with car #64 (enter to omit): Another team
Name of team with car #045 (enter to omit): 
Name of team with car #124 (enter to omit): Bratwurst Racing
</code>

  * Updated https://wiki.apx.chmr.eu/doku.php?id=import to represent new import logic

  * Removed the validation on the component name to allow non-standardized names to be used (even as it's utter nonsense)

  * Re-add welcome message to the event

  * Add placeholder information to the help text of the welcome message field
