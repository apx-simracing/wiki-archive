====== Remove Branding ======

Per default, APX will deploy servers with the name "[APX] {yourname}". This is done do publicly show the usage of APX to reach more users as it's otherwise quite hart to reach people.

If you want to disable it, open //wizard/webgui/models.py// and set //ADDPREFIX// to //False//. 

You will have to restart the wizard instance (if it's not in DEBUG mode) and redeploy all affected servers after changing the setting.

If you want to show that your servers are using APX, you can additionally use one of the prepared logos form the [[support|support]] article.
