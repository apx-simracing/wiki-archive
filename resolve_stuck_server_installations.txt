====== Resolve stuck server installations ======


If your server keeps to be stuck inside "downloading reciever release" or "doing reciever bootstrap", you can delete the entry and add a new server. From failures at download and bootstrap there is no recovery.

The safest path is currently to exit the wizard (using CONTROL + C in the terminal), start it again, delete the server and start again.

====== "The server was not processed yet" ======

  - Deselect action and event
  - Save the server
  - If the reciever for this server runs, the key file should be collected now
  - Refresh the page, if the key field is filled, you can continue as usual.
