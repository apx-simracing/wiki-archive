====== Update rFM settings ======

In the Race conditions screen, you have two options:

  - Upload a rfm file
  - Set settings in the screen


===== Set settings =====

You can set one option per line. Follow the syntax key=value.

**Exception** Pit groups will be set using GroupX=value (as there are multiple lines with same key in the rFm)

==== Examples ====

  - //RaceStart = 16:00//
  - //Group16 = 3// (will generate PitGroup = 3, Group16)


===== Restore defaults settings =====

  - Select the "clear" box on the filename
  - Empty the settings box
  - Save the race weekend
