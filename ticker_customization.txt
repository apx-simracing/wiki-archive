====== Ticker/ Livetiming customization ======

===== General concept =====

  * The reciever hooks are submitting data into the wizard app
  * The livetiming/ ticker is a plain webtechnology project. You can basically customize everything as long as you have basic knowledge about that
  * A Vue.js instance within the timing loads the data out of the wizard
  * On first request, the wizard will collect livery thumbnails from the server itself
  * There is no direct request towards the server itself


===== Thumbnails not loading ===== 

As listed on the article [[security_considerations|Security considerations]], you should use a proxy to publicly serve contents. The wizard does not host these contents.

To serve thumbnails, start a webserver to host the contents of the //uploads// folder. Update the [[setup_wizard|MEDIA_URL of settings.py]] accordingly.

===== Classes coloring =====

If you have for example a class "GT3" configured (taken from the VEH files), the ticker will use the class "class-gt3" (in general "class-" + class name in lowercase). Add an corresponding entry in the a new file, e. g. //yourleague.css// (it's located within the folder //wizard/webgui/static/webgui///. It should be located on the same level as the file //timing.css//.

Avoid whitespaces in your class names
</WRAP>


Example:

<code>
/* Consider using "!important" if needed. */
.class-gt3 {
  background-color: red !important;
  color: white !important;
}
</code>

Don't forget to include your  new CSS file:

<code>
  <!-- Add your custom includes after this line -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'webgui/yourleaguename.css' %}">
</code>

===== Classes rename =====

In case you realized that your class names are off, the ticker offers you the chance to overwrite that. Within your event configuration, you can add a key-value map for this. The input will be validated on save. Must be a valid JavaScript object.

Merging of multiple classes into one is not supported as the server will group the vehicles by the original class descriptions.

Example:

{{::timing_overwrite.png?nolink|}}
