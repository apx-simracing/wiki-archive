====== How to add skins ======

<WRAP center round important 60%>
Using stock skins and own skins at once is currently not supported. Please add your own "stock skins".
</WRAP>

====== Add entry ======

If you enable signups on the event, files and entries can be created by the participants themself: https://wiki.apx.chmr.eu/doku.php?id=event_signup

You can also add the entry by yourself:

{{::entry.png?nolink&800|}}

The field "base class" is only needed if a mod has multiple specifications, such as the GT4 and Cup ones in the A110 mod.


====== Add files ======

Now you have to upload the files for the entry (liveries most likely). You can add them in the entry files section. Select the newly created car (e. g. the #123 from the last step) and upload files.

You have to repeat this step per file needed. For larger amounts of files, there is an import available: https://wiki.apx.chmr.eu/doku.php?id=import

====== Use the entry ======

In the event, select your newly created entry in the entries section.

{{::event.png?nolink&800|}}

====== Update ======


Go to your desired server, select the event and update the server. Everything else will be taken care by APX.

**Thats all.**
